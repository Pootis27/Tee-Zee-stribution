        Z-distribution and T-distributions are both statistical tools used to draw calculations from sample data. However, it can be confusing to know which of them to use given a situation. <br></p>
    <p style="font-size:larger;">A Z-distribution is used when <b>we know the standard deviation of the population and the population is normally distributed</b>, regardless of sample size. It should be noted that population standard deviation should not be confused with sample standard deviation and that if the type of distribution is unknown, it should be considered as if the distribution is not normally distributed. In other words, as long as we know a standard deviation and that we know it is normally distributed, we should default to using the z-test.</p>
    <p style="font-size:x-large;">σ = Known &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Distribution = Normal &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp -∞ &lt n &lt +∞</p><br>
    <p style="font-size:larger;">
        On the other hand, T-distribution is used when <b>we don't know the standard deviation of the population or when we don't know if it is normally distributed or not, and when the sample size is less than 30</b>. A good key thing to be able to remember this easily is that T-distribution specializes in smaller sample size. With this in mind, we now only have to check if one or both of the other two criteria is met.</p><br>
        <p style="font-size:x-large;">σ = Known/Unknown &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Distribution = Normal/Not Normal&nbsp&nbsp &#x28;Cannot be both Known and Normal&#x29; &nbsp&nbsp  n &lt; 30</p><br>
        <p style="font-size:larger;"> Now, there exists cases in which we can use either which is when <b>we don't know the standard deviation of the population or when we don't know if it is normally distributed or not, but the sample size is more than 30</b>. We can use the Z-distribution and T-distribution here because of the central limit theorem which states that as our sample gets larger, it approximates or becomes more and more like the normal distribution. What this means is that the difference between using a Z-distribution and T-distribution as the sample size gets larger becomes almost indestinguishable from each other. In cases like these, however, it is often preferrable to use a Z-distribution as it is more accurate.</p>
        <p style="font-size:x-large;">σ = Known/Unknown &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Distribution = Normal/Not Normal&nbsp&nbsp &#x28;Cannot be both Known and Normal&#x29; &nbsp&nbsp. n &ge; 30</p><br>
